# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Network Scanner Application

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Network Scanner Application is a script-based tool designed to scan local networks using the NMAP utility. Its primary purpose is to track devices connecting to and disconnecting from the network, maintaining logs of network events. The application will integrate with the Home Assistant home automation system to enable alerts and device management. This tool aims to provide seamless device tracking and network monitoring for a single user, enhancing home automation capabilities.

## 2. Goals

- Develop a script (Python or Node.js) that schedules network scans approximately every minute.
- Detect and log changes in network devices by comparing current scans with previous results.
- Allow the user to assign names and descriptions to tracked devices.
- Integrate with Home Assistant for alerting when new devices join the network.
- Provide a simple web frontend to manage devices (naming, descriptions) and view network events.
- Ensure the solution is clear, maintainable, and suitable for implementation by a junior developer.

## 3. User Stories

- As a home automation enthusiast, I want to automatically detect new devices on my local network so that I can monitor network activity.
- As a user, I want to assign friendly names and descriptions to devices so that I can easily identify them.
- As a user, I want to receive alerts via Home Assistant when new devices connect to my network.
- As a user, I want a simple web interface to manage device information and view network events.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must schedule network scans approximately every 60 seconds using the NMAP utility.
2. The system must compare each scan's results with the previous scan to detect new or removed devices.
3. The system must maintain a persistent log of network events, including device arrivals and departures.
4. The system must allow the user to assign and update names and descriptions for each tracked device.
5. The system must provide an API or integration mechanism to send alerts to Home Assistant when new devices are detected.
6. The system must include a simple web frontend that allows device management (naming, descriptions) and displays network event logs.
7. The system must store device and event data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON or database) to support persistence and querying.
8. The system must be implemented in Python or Node.js, based on developer preference and environment suitability.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The system will not provide advanced network security features such as intrusion detection or firewall management.
- The system will not support multiple users or multi-tenant environments.
- The system will not include complex UI/UX designs beyond a simple web frontend for device management.
- The system will not handle integration with home automation systems other than Home Assistant in the initial version.

## 6. Design Considerations

- The web frontend should be minimalistic but functional, focusing on device management and event viewing.
- The system should be designed for easy scheduling via OS-level task schedulers (e.g., cron, Windows Task Scheduler).
- Data storage should balance simplicity and extensibility; JSON files or lightweight databases like SQLite are acceptable.
- Integration with Home Assistant should leverage its existing APIs or MQTT messaging for alerts.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The NMAP utility must be installed and accessible on the host system.
- The script should handle errors gracefully, including network unavailability or NMAP failures.
- The system should be modular to allow future enhancements, such as supporting additional home automation platforms.
- Security considerations include protecting stored device data and ensuring safe integration with Home Assistant.

## 8. Success Metrics

- The script runs successfully on schedule and completes network scans every minute.
- New devices are detected and logged accurately with minimal false positives.
- Device naming and description management is functional and user-friendly via the web frontend.
- Alerts are successfully sent to Home Assistant upon detection of new devices.
- The system is maintainable and understandable by a junior developer following the PRD.

## 9. Open Questions

- Which programming language (Python or Node.js) is preferred for the initial implementation?
- What is the preferred data storage format for device and event logs?
- What is the best approach for integrating alerts with Home Assistant (e.g., API calls, MQTT)?
- Are there any specific security requirements for data storage and communication?
- Should the web frontend support real-time updates or periodic refreshes?
